          </gov-body>

          <gov-list bullet>
            <li>
              You will be asked to provide information a customer would want to
              know about your support listing - make sure you have it to hand
            </li>
            <li>
              You can add as many support listings as you want - so please split your
              support listings into multiple pages as appropriate
            </li>
            <li>
              When you are finished your page will be sent to the admin team for
              approval
            </li>
          </gov-list>
